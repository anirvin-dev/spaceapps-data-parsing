## üéØ **Demo Script for Judges**

### **Opening [0:00-0:30]**

> "We built a comprehensive NASA space biology knowledge engine integrating **2,114 data sources** - 607 research papers with 108 fully analyzed, plus 1,507 additional NASA missions, experiments, and datasets."

### **Paper Summaries [0:30-1:30]**

**Navigate to:** Paper Explorer ‚Üí Show Paper 15, 25, 50

> "Every paper gets dual AI summaries. **Extractive** preserves exact scientific quotes for accuracy. **Abstractive** provides readable overviews. This hybrid approach prevents AI hallucinations while maintaining scientific rigor. We've fully analyzed 108 papers covering topics from bone loss to plant biology to radiation effects."

### **Topic Clustering [1:30-2:00]**

**Navigate to:** Topic Analysis

> "Our system identified **10 major research themes** using advanced NLP. From bone degradation affecting Mars missions, to immune system changes, to plant biology for sustainable food production. Each topic clusters related research and reveals trends."

### **Evidence-Backed Consensus [2:00-2:30]**

**Navigate to:** Consensus Claims ‚Üí Click a high-confidence claim

> "We extract scientific claims and compute **consensus scores** based on supporting evidence across papers. This claim has 85%+ confidence from 12 papers. Click to see exact source sentences - complete traceability to original research."

### **Knowledge Gaps [2:30-3:00]**

**Navigate to:** Knowledge Gaps ‚Üí Show high-priority gap

> "The system identifies **knowledge gaps** - areas with high mission relevance but low research density. This gap shows what we need to study more before Mars missions. Each includes recommended experiments."

### **Mission Insights [3:00-3:30]**

**Navigate to:** Mission Insights ‚Üí Show high-risk finding

> "We convert literature into **actionable mission insights**. High-risk findings require immediate countermeasures. Medium-risk need monitoring. Each includes specific recommendations for mission planners."

### **Multi-Source Integration [3:30-4:00]**

**Navigate to:** Additional NASA Sources ‚Üí Filter "NASA OSDR"

> "Beyond papers, we integrated **1,507 additional sources** - biological experiments from NASA's Open Science Data Repository, Task Book research projects, and mission data. One unified, searchable knowledge base."

### **Closing [4:00-4:30]**

> "This system transforms 600+ scattered research papers and 1,500+ NASA sources into actionable insights. Evidence-backed consensus, knowledge gap detection, and mission recommendations - all with complete traceability. Ready for operational use in mission planning."
