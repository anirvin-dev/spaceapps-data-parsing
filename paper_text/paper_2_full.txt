Abstract Microgravity exposure leads to significant bone loss in astronauts, particularly in weight-bearing bones. This study investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying pelvic bone loss in a murine model of spaceflight. We found that microgravity increases osteoclastic activity while inhibiting osteoblastic function, leading to net bone resorption. Introduction Bone loss is one of the most significant health concerns for astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. Understanding the cellular mechanisms is essential for developing effective countermeasures. This study focused on the pelvic region, which experiences significant bone loss in microgravity. Methods Thirty-six mice were subjected to hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity conditions. Bone density measurements were taken at baseline and after  days of unloading. Osteoclast and osteoblast activity were assessed through histological analysis and gene expression studies. Results Hindlimb unloading resulted in significant pelvic bone loss ( reduction in bone mineral density). Osteoclast activity increased by , while osteoblast activity decreased by . Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of osteoclastogenic factors and downregulation of osteoblastic markers. Conclusion Microgravity-induced pelvic bone loss is primarily mediated by increased osteoclastic activity and decreased osteoblastic function. These findings suggest that targeting osteoclast activity may be an effective strategy for preventing bone loss in spaceflight.
