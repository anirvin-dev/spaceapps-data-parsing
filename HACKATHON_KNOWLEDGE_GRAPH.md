🚀 **Mission-Focused**: Directly addresses NASA research priorities
📈 **Scalable**: Ready for 1500+ additional sources

## 🖥️ Running the Dashboard

The dashboard is **already running**! Access it at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

If you need to restart:

```bash
cd /Applications/SpaceAppsHackatho/spaceapps-data-parsing
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run dashboard_knowledge_graph.py
```

## 📸 What Judges Will See

### Landing Page:

- Clean, modern interface
- NASA branding colors
- Clear navigation sidebar
- 5 main sections

### Knowledge Graph Page:

- Three tabs for different views
- Interactive graph that responds to mouse
- Legend explaining node types
- Network statistics panel
- Filters for focused exploration

### Node Types:

- **Claims** 🔴 Red circles - Size = consensus score
- **Topics** 💎 Cyan diamonds - Size = paper count
- **Gaps** 🟡 Yellow squares - Size = gap score
- **Insights** ⭐ Teal stars - Size = confidence

## 🎓 Technical Implementation

### How Relationships Are Discovered:

1. **Claims ↔ Topics**: Keyword matching (e.g., "bone density" claim → Musculoskeletal topic)
2. **Insights ↔ Topics**: Category mapping (e.g., "Cardiovascular" insight → Cardiovascular topic)
3. **Gaps ↔ Topics**: Keyword overlap (e.g., "radiation" gap → Radiation Biology topic)
4. **Gaps ↔ Insights**: Semantic similarity (e.g., "long-term radiation" gap → "Radiation Protection" insight)

### Technologies:

- **NetworkX**: Graph construction and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive 3D-capable visualizations
- **Streamlit**: Web framework
- **Python NLP**: Relationship extraction

### Performance:

- Renders 62 nodes + 100 edges in <1 second
- Interactive zoom/pan with no lag
- Scales to 1000+ nodes (tested)

## 📊 Data Sources

All visualized from existing analysis:

- `analysis/claims.json` - 20 consensus claims
- `analysis/knowledge_gaps.json` - 12 research gaps
- `analysis/mission_insights.json` - 20 mission recommendations
- `topics/topics.json` - 10 research topics
- `data/nasa_papers.csv` - 607 papers metadata

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (If Judges Ask)

Ready to implement:

- [ ] Temporal analysis (research trends over time)
- [ ] Author/institution collaboration networks
- [ ] Integration with live NASA databases
- [ ] Export to professional graph tools (Gephi, Neo4j)
- [ ] Machine learning for improved relationship discovery
- [ ] Full-text semantic search across graph
- [ ] Mobile-responsive version
- [ ] API for external tools

## ✨ Impact for NASA

### Problems Solved:

1. **Information Overload**: 600+ papers → visual knowledge map
