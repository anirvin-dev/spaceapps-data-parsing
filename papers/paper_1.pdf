        Abstract
        The Bion-M1 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of spaceflight on mammalian physiology. 
        This study examined the training and selection process for mice participating in the 30-day orbital mission. 
        Mice were selected based on health criteria, behavioral assessments, and stress tolerance. Training protocols 
        included habituation to confinement and simulated microgravity conditions.
        
        Introduction
        Spaceflight presents numerous challenges to mammalian physiology, including microgravity, radiation exposure, 
        and psychological stress. Understanding these effects is crucial for long-duration space missions. The Bion-M1 
        mission provided an opportunity to study these effects in a controlled environment.
        
        Methods
        Twenty mice were selected from a pool of 50 candidates based on health screenings, behavioral tests, and 
        stress response assessments. Selected mice underwent 30 days of training including confinement habituation, 
        vibration exposure, and simulated microgravity conditions using a rotating platform.
        
        Results
        The training protocol significantly improved mouse adaptation to spaceflight conditions. Mice showed reduced 
        stress responses and improved behavioral adaptation. Post-flight analysis revealed changes in bone density, 
        muscle mass, and immune function consistent with microgravity effects.
        
        Conclusion
        The training and selection protocol successfully prepared mice for spaceflight conditions. These findings 
        provide valuable insights for future space biology experiments and have implications for human spaceflight 
        preparation.
