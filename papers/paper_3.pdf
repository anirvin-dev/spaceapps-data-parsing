        Stem cell function is crucial for tissue regeneration and maintenance. This study examined how microgravity 
        affects stem cell health and regenerative capacity using human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in simulated 
        microgravity conditions. We found that microgravity alters stem cell morphology, proliferation, and 
        differentiation potential.
        
        Introduction
        Stem cells play a vital role in tissue regeneration and repair. Understanding how spaceflight affects 
        stem cell function is important for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration missions. This 
        study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on human mesenchymal stem cells.
        
        Methods
        Human mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in a rotating wall vessel to simulate microgravity conditions. 
        Cell morphology, proliferation rates, and differentiation potential were assessed over 7 days. Gene 
        expression analysis was performed to identify molecular changes associated with microgravity exposure.
        
        Results
        Simulated microgravity altered stem cell morphology, with cells becoming more rounded and less adherent. 
        Proliferation rates decreased by 30%, and differentiation potential was significantly impaired. Gene 
        expression analysis revealed changes in cytoskeletal genes, growth factor receptors, and differentiation markers.
        
        Conclusion
        Microgravity significantly impairs stem cell function and regenerative capacity. These findings have 
        important implications for astronaut health and suggest the need for countermeasures to maintain 
        stem cell function during spaceflight.
