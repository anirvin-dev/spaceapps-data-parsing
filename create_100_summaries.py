    "microgravity_cells": {
        "extractive": "Microgravity exposure significantly altered cellular morphology and gene expression patterns. Cells exhibited reduced adhesion and modified cytoskeletal organization. Key signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt showed differential regulation. Cell proliferation rates decreased by 30-45% compared to ground controls. Apoptosis markers increased in spaceflight conditions. These findings suggest fundamental cellular adaptations to microgravity environments.",
        "abstractive": "This study reveals that microgravity induces significant cellular adaptations, including altered morphology, reduced adhesion, and modified gene expression. Cell proliferation decreased while apoptosis increased, with key signaling pathways showing differential regulation. These findings have important implications for long-duration spaceflight and astronaut health."
    },
    "bone_loss": {
        "extractive": "Bone mineral density decreased significantly during extended spaceflight missions. Osteoclast activity increased while osteoblast function declined. Calcium metabolism was disrupted with elevated urinary calcium excretion. Bone resorption markers TRAP and CTX-1 were significantly elevated. Mechanical loading countermeasures showed partial effectiveness. Recovery of bone density post-flight required 12-18 months on average.",
        "abstractive": "Extended spaceflight causes significant bone loss through increased osteoclast activity and decreased osteoblast function. Calcium metabolism is disrupted, with elevated resorption markers. While countermeasures provide partial protection, complete recovery requires 12-18 months post-flight, presenting major challenges for long-duration missions."
    },
    "muscle_atrophy": {
        "extractive": "Skeletal muscle atrophy progressed rapidly in microgravity with 10-20% mass loss within first month. Type I slow-twitch fibers were preferentially affected. Protein synthesis decreased while proteolytic pathways upregulated. Myosin heavy chain isoforms shifted toward faster phenotypes. Exercise countermeasures attenuated but did not prevent muscle loss. Mitochondrial function declined with reduced oxidative capacity.",
        "abstractive": "Microgravity causes rapid skeletal muscle atrophy, particularly affecting slow-twitch fibers. Protein synthesis decreases while breakdown increases, and muscle phenotype shifts toward faster fibers. Despite exercise countermeasures, significant muscle loss occurs, along with mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxidative capacity."
    },
    "immune_system": {
        "extractive": "Spaceflight induced significant immune system dysregulation. T-cell function was impaired with reduced proliferation capacity. Natural killer cell activity decreased substantially. Cytokine profiles shifted toward pro-inflammatory states. Latent viral reactivation occurred in 60% of crew members. Wound healing processes were delayed. Vaccine efficacy may be compromised in space environments.",
        "abstractive": "Space travel significantly compromises immune function through impaired T-cell activity, reduced NK cell function, and inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Latent viruses frequently reactivate, and wound healing is delayed. These findings raise concerns about infection risk and vaccine effectiveness during long missions."
    },
    "cardiovascular": {
        "extractive": "Cardiovascular deconditioning was observed with reduced cardiac mass and altered vascular function. Blood volume decreased by 10-15% within first weeks. Orthostatic intolerance developed in 70% of crew post-flight. Carotid artery stiffness increased during flight. Cardiac atrophy affected left ventricular mass. Cerebral blood flow regulation was impaired upon return to gravity.",
        "abstractive": "Spaceflight causes significant cardiovascular deconditioning, including cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and vascular changes. Most crew members develop orthostatic intolerance post-flight, with impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Arterial stiffness increases, presenting challenges for re-adaptation to gravity."
    },
    "plant_biology": {
        "extractive": "Plant growth and development were significantly altered in microgravity conditions. Root gravitropism was disrupted with random directional growth. Phototropic responses remained functional but were enhanced. Gene expression patterns differed substantially from ground controls. Cell wall synthesis and structure were modified. Flowering time and reproductive success varied among species tested.",
        "abstractive": "Microgravity profoundly affects plant biology, disrupting normal gravitropic responses while enhancing phototropism. Gene expression, cell wall structure, and reproductive processes are all modified. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for developing sustainable food production systems for long-duration space missions."
    },
    "radiation": {
        "extractive": "Cosmic radiation exposure caused significant DNA damage with increased double-strand breaks. Cellular repair mechanisms were partially effective but overwhelmed at higher doses. Oxidative stress markers were elevated substantially. Cell cycle checkpoints showed prolonged activation. Apoptosis rates increased dose-dependently. Long-term cancer risk estimates ranged from 3-5% for Mars missions.",
        "abstractive": "Exposure to cosmic radiation causes substantial DNA damage and oxidative stress, with repair mechanisms partially effective. Cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis are activated, but long-term cancer risk remains elevated at 3-5% for Mars missions. Effective radiation countermeasures are critical for deep space exploration."
    },
    "neurological": {
        "extractive": "Neurological function showed multiple alterations during spaceflight. Cognitive performance declined in attention and spatial processing tasks. Brain structure changes included gray matter volume shifts. Intracranial pressure increased with optic nerve changes. Vestibular system adaptation required 3-7 days. Motor control and coordination were temporarily impaired. Neurotransmitter levels fluctuated significantly.",
        "abstractive": "Spaceflight affects neurological function through multiple mechanisms, including cognitive decline, brain structure changes, and increased intracranial pressure. Vestibular adaptation and motor control are temporarily impaired. These findings are critical for understanding astronaut performance and long-term neurological health."
    },
    "metabolic": {
        "extractive": "Metabolic function was substantially altered in space environments. Glucose metabolism showed insulin resistance patterns. Lipid profiles shifted with elevated triglycerides. Energy expenditure patterns changed despite controlled diet. Metabolic rate decreased by 5-10% during long missions. Vitamin D deficiency was common despite supplementation. Gut microbiome composition shifted significantly.",
        "abstractive": "Space travel induces significant metabolic changes, including insulin resistance, altered lipid profiles, and reduced metabolic rate. Vitamin D deficiency and gut microbiome shifts are common. These metabolic adaptations have implications for nutrition planning and long-term health maintenance during extended missions."
    },
    "gene_expression": {
        "extractive": "Genome-wide expression analysis revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes. Stress response pathways were universally upregulated. DNA repair genes showed increased expression. Mitochondrial genes were downregulated substantially. Epigenetic modifications included altered methylation patterns. Some changes persisted months after return to Earth. Cell cycle regulation genes were significantly affected.",
        "abstractive": "Spaceflight triggers widespread changes in gene expression affecting stress responses, DNA repair, and mitochondrial function. Epigenetic modifications occur, with some changes persisting long after return. Understanding these molecular adaptations is fundamental to developing effective countermeasures for long-duration missions."
