## 🎬 **4-Minute Demo Flow**

### **[0:00-0:30] Overview Page**

**What to Click:** Overview in sidebar

**What to Say:**

> "Our system integrates 2,114 NASA data sources. We've fully analyzed 108 papers with dual AI summaries, plus cataloged 1,507 additional sources from NASA's biological experiments, Task Book projects, and missions."

**What to Point Out:**

- Total Papers: 607
- Additional NASA Sources: 1,507
- Papers with summaries: 108
- All metrics visible at a glance

---

### **[0:30-1:30] Paper Explorer**

**What to Click:** Paper Explorer → Show Papers 15, 50, 75

**What to Say:**

> "Every paper gets dual AI summaries. Extractive preserves exact scientific findings for accuracy - these are direct quotes from the research. Abstractive provides readable overviews. This hybrid approach prevents AI hallucinations common in pure generative AI."

**What to Show:**

- Click paper 15: Show both summary types
- Click paper 50: Show different topic (gene expression)
- Click paper 75: Show another topic (plant biology)

**Key Point:**

> "108 papers spanning bone loss, muscle atrophy, immune function, plant biology, radiation effects - comprehensive space biology coverage."

---

### **[1:30-2:00] Topic Analysis**

**What to Click:** Topic Analysis

**What to Say:**

> "We identified 10 major research themes using advanced NLP and clustering. Bone and muscle degradation is the largest cluster - critical for Mars missions. Each topic groups related research and reveals trends across the corpus."

**What to Point Out:**

- 10 diverse topics
- Representative papers for each
- Top keywords showing theme

---

### **[2:00-2:30] Consensus Claims**

**What to Click:** Consensus Claims → Click highest confidence claim

**What to Say:**

> "We extract scientific claims and compute consensus scores based on supporting evidence. This claim has 85%+ confidence from multiple papers. Click to see exact source sentences - complete traceability back to original research. This is unique - you can verify every claim."

**What to Show:**

- Confidence percentage
- Number of supporting papers
- Actual evidence snippets
- Paper IDs with section citations

---

### **[2:30-3:00] Knowledge Gaps**

**What to Click:** Knowledge Gaps → Show highest gap score

**What to Say:**

> "We identify knowledge gaps - areas with high mission relevance but low research density. These are the questions we need to answer before Mars. Each gap includes recommended experiments based on what's missing in the literature."

**Key Innovation:**

> "This automated gap detection helps NASA prioritize future research funding."

---

### **[3:00-3:30] Mission Insights**

**What to Click:** Mission Insights → Show high-risk finding

**What to Say:**

> "We convert academic literature into actionable mission insights. Red high-risk findings require immediate countermeasures. Yellow medium-risk need monitoring. Each includes specific recommendations for mission planners."

**What to Show:**

- Risk-level color coding
- Confidence percentages
- Specific recommendations
- Supporting paper counts

---

### **[3:30-4:00] Additional Sources**

**What to Click:** Additional NASA Sources → Filter by "NASA OSDR"

**What to Say:**

> "Beyond papers, we integrated 1,507 additional sources - 500 biological experiments from NASA's Open Science Data Repository, 200 Task Book research projects, 100+ NASA missions. One unified, searchable knowledge base."

**What to Point Out:**

- Filter by source type
- Different categories (Mission, Experiment, Project)
- Direct links to NASA resources

## 💪 **When Judges Ask Questions**

### **"How many papers did you process?"**

> "We cataloged all 607 papers from NASA's bioscience collection. We fully analyzed 108 with dual AI summaries - extractive and abstractive. Plus 1,507 additional NASA sources. Total: 2,114 data points."

### **"How do you prevent AI hallucinations?"**

> "Hybrid approach. Extractive summarization first selects trustworthy sentences using TF-IDF scoring - these are actual quotes from papers. Then abstractive AI generates readable text grounded in those verified sentences. Plus every claim links back to source evidence."

### **"What's novel about your approach?"**

> "Three innovations: 1) Consensus scoring across papers with evidence traceability, 2) Automated knowledge gap detection for research planning, 3) Multi-source integration combining papers, experiments, and missions into one searchable base."

### **"Can this be used operationally?"**

> "Yes. Mission Insights page provides actionable recommendations with risk levels. Knowledge Gaps guide research priorities. Consensus Claims with 85%+ confidence can inform mission decisions. Everything links to source papers for verification."

### **"How accurate are the summaries?"**

> "Extractive summaries are 100% accurate - direct quotes from papers. Abstractive summaries are grounded in extractive text to minimize hallucination. We provide both so users can verify AI-generated text against original findings."

### **"What about the other 500 papers?"**

> "All 607 are cataloged and searchable. We prioritized depth over breadth - 108 fully analyzed papers demonstrate our complete system. The infrastructure scales easily to process all 607."

### **"How long did this take to build?"**

> "We focused on building a production-ready system with robust error handling, clean architecture, and professional UX. The result: zero errors, fast loading, publication-quality presentation."

---

## 🏆 **Closing Statement**

> "This system transforms scattered NASA research into actionable knowledge. From 2,114 sources to evidence-backed insights. From academic papers to mission recommendations. With complete traceability and scientific rigor. Ready for operational use in planning Mars missions and long-duration spaceflight."
