Study examining hsfa2 functions in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated. Microgravity profoundly affects plant biology, disrupting normal gravitropic responses while enhancing phototropism. Gene expression, cell wall structure, and reproductive processes are all modified. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for developing sustainable food production systems for long-duration space missions.
