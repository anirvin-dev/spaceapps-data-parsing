Study examining microbiomes of the dust particles collected from the. Exposure to cosmic radiation causes substantial DNA damage and oxidative stress, with repair mechanisms partially effective. Cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis are activated, but long-term cancer risk remains elevated at 3-5% for Mars missions. Effective radiation countermeasures are critical for deep space exploration.
