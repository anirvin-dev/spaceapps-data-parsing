Microgravity exposure leads to significant bone loss in astronauts, particularly in weight-bearing bones. This study investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying pelvic bone loss. We found that microgravity increases osteoclastic activity while inhibiting osteoblastic function, leading to net bone resorption.
