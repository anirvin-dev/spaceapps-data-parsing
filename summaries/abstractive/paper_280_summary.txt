Study examining functional consequences of radiation-induced oxidative stress in cultured. Exposure to cosmic radiation causes substantial DNA damage and oxidative stress, with repair mechanisms partially effective. Cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis are activated, but long-term cancer risk remains elevated at 3-5% for Mars missions. Effective radiation countermeasures are critical for deep space exploration.
