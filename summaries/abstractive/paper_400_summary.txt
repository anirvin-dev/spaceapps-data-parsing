Study examining transcriptomic effects on the mouse heart following 30. Spaceflight causes significant cardiovascular deconditioning, including cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and vascular changes. Most crew members develop orthostatic intolerance post-flight, with impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Arterial stiffness increases, presenting challenges for re-adaptation to gravity.
