Spaceflight induces oxidative stress and disrupts normal cell cycle regulation. This study examined gene expression changes in response to spaceflight exposure. Results showed significant alterations in antioxidant defense systems and cell cycle control mechanisms, highlighting potential health risks and the need for protective interventions during space missions.
