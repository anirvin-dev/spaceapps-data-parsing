Study examining spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse. Spaceflight causes significant cardiovascular deconditioning, including cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and vascular changes. Most crew members develop orthostatic intolerance post-flight, with impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Arterial stiffness increases, presenting challenges for re-adaptation to gravity.
