Space radiation may affect the structural integrity of biological tissues through damage to collagen, a critical protein in connective tissue. This study examined radiation effects on collagen structure and mechanical properties. Results showed dose-dependent degradation of collagen organization and strength, suggesting potential concerns for tissue health during long-duration spaceflight and the need for protective strategies.
