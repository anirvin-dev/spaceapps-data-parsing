Real-time molecular analysis is crucial for monitoring astronaut health and biological experiments during spaceflight. This study validated an innovative RNA isolation and gene expression analysis system on the ISS. The system successfully processed samples and detected significant changes in stress-related genes, demonstrating its utility for space-based research and diagnostics.
