Study examining simulated microgravity promotes horizontal gene transfer of antimicrobial. Spaceflight triggers widespread changes in gene expression affecting stress responses, DNA repair, and mitochondrial function. Epigenetic modifications occur, with some changes persisting long after return. Understanding these molecular adaptations is fundamental to developing effective countermeasures for long-duration missions.
