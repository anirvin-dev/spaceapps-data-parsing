Study examining simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity. Spaceflight causes significant cardiovascular deconditioning, including cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and vascular changes. Most crew members develop orthostatic intolerance post-flight, with impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Arterial stiffness increases, presenting challenges for re-adaptation to gravity.
