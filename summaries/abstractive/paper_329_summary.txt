Study examining the influence of spaceflight on the astronaut salivary. Space travel significantly compromises immune function through impaired T-cell activity, reduced NK cell function, and inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Latent viruses frequently reactivate, and wound healing is delayed. These findings raise concerns about infection risk and vaccine effectiveness during long missions.
