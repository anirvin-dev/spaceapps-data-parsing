Stem cells play a vital role in tissue regeneration and repair. Understanding how spaceflight affects stem cell function is important for maintaining astronaut health. This study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on human mesenchymal stem cells. We found that microgravity alters stem cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation potential.
