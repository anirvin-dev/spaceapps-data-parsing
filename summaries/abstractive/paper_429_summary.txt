Study examining structural and functional properties of bone are compromised. Extended spaceflight causes significant bone loss through increased osteoclast activity and decreased osteoblast function. Calcium metabolism is disrupted, with elevated resorption markers. While countermeasures provide partial protection, complete recovery requires 12-18 months post-flight, presenting major challenges for long-duration missions.
