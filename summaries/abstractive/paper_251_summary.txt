Study examining genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading. Extended spaceflight causes significant bone loss through increased osteoclast activity and decreased osteoblast function. Calcium metabolism is disrupted, with elevated resorption markers. While countermeasures provide partial protection, complete recovery requires 12-18 months post-flight, presenting major challenges for long-duration missions.
