Space radiation poses significant health risks to astronauts on deep space missions. This study investigated how different radiation types and doses affect oxidative stress responses. Results demonstrated that high-energy particles cause more severe cellular damage than traditional radiation, emphasizing the need for enhanced radiation protection strategies for Mars missions and beyond.
