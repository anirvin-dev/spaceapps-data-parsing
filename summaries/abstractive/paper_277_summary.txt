Study examining trimeric structure of (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein at 1.95. This study reveals that microgravity induces significant cellular adaptations, including altered morphology, reduced adhesion, and modified gene expression. Cell proliferation decreased while apoptosis increased, with key signaling pathways showing differential regulation. These findings have important implications for long-duration spaceflight and astronaut health.
