Study examining genomic, functional, and metabolic enhancements in multidrug-resistant enterobacter. Space travel induces significant metabolic changes, including insulin resistance, altered lipid profiles, and reduced metabolic rate. Vitamin D deficiency and gut microbiome shifts are common. These metabolic adaptations have implications for nutrition planning and long-term health maintenance during extended missions.
