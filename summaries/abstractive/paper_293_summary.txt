Study examining effects of spaceflight on the brain. Spaceflight affects neurological function through multiple mechanisms, including cognitive decline, brain structure changes, and increased intracranial pressure. Vestibular adaptation and motor control are temporarily impaired. These findings are critical for understanding astronaut performance and long-term neurological health.
