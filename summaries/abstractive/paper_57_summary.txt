Study examining spaceflight and hind limb unloading induce similar changes. Microgravity causes rapid skeletal muscle atrophy, particularly affecting slow-twitch fibers. Protein synthesis decreases while breakdown increases, and muscle phenotype shifts toward faster fibers. Despite exercise countermeasures, significant muscle loss occurs, along with mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxidative capacity.
