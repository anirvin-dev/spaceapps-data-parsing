Study examining apollo lunar astronauts show higher cardiovascular disease mortality:. Spaceflight causes significant cardiovascular deconditioning, including cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and vascular changes. Most crew members develop orthostatic intolerance post-flight, with impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Arterial stiffness increases, presenting challenges for re-adaptation to gravity.
