Understanding bone mechanobiology is crucial for developing countermeasures against spaceflight-induced bone loss. This study presents an innovative high-precision system for applying controlled mechanical loads to animal bones, enabling detailed investigation of how bones respond to mechanical stimulation. This technology supports research on exercise-based countermeasures for astronaut bone health.
