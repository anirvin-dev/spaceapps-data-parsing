Study examining absence of gamma-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70s6. Bone mineral density decreased significantly during extended spaceflight missions. Osteoclast activity increased while osteoblast function declined. Calcium metabolism was disrupted with elevated urinary calcium excretion. Bone resorption markers TRAP and CTX-1 were significantly elevated. Mechanical loading countermeasures showed partial effectiveness. Recovery of bone density post-flight required 12-18 months on average.
