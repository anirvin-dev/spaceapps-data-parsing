NASA's life sciences research program integrates basic science with clinical care to support human space exploration. The program addresses critical health challenges including bone loss, muscle atrophy, and immune dysfunction. Research findings are translated into evidence-based medical protocols for spaceflight operations. Integration of research and clinical care improves both astronaut health and terrestrial medicine. This bench-to-bedside approach accelerates medical innovation for space and Earth applications.
