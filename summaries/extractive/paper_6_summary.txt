Spaceflight exposure resulted in significant modulation of oxidative stress response genes and cell cycle regulators. Key antioxidant enzymes showed altered expression patterns during and after spaceflight. The study identified potential biomarkers for spaceflight-induced oxidative stress. Cell cycle checkpoint genes were downregulated, suggesting increased vulnerability to DNA damage. These molecular changes may contribute to long-term health risks associated with space travel.
