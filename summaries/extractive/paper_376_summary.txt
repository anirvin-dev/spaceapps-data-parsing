Study examining the 14-3-3 proteins of arabidopsis regulate root growth. Plant growth and development were significantly altered in microgravity conditions. Root gravitropism was disrupted with random directional growth. Phototropic responses remained functional but were enhanced. Gene expression patterns differed substantially from ground controls. Cell wall synthesis and structure were modified. Flowering time and reproductive success varied among species tested.
