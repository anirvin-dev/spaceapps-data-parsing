This study examined the training and selection process for mice participating in the -day orbital mission. Abstract The Bion-M1 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of spaceflight on mammalian physiology. Methods Twenty mice were selected from a pool of  candidates based on health screenings, behavioral tests, and stress response assessments. Selected mice underwent  days of training including confinement habituation, vibration exposure, and simulated microgravity conditions using a rotating platform. Conclusion The training and selection protocol successfully prepared mice for spaceflight conditions.
