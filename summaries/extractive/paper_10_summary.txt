Ionizing radiation exposure significantly altered collagen structure and mechanical properties in tissue samples. Radiation-induced damage accumulated with increasing dose, affecting collagen fibril organization. Mechanical testing revealed decreased tensile strength and elasticity in irradiated samples. Structural analysis using microscopy showed disruption of collagen cross-linking patterns. These findings have implications for tissue engineering and radiation protection in space environments.
