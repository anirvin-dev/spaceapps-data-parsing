Study examining metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through. Metabolic function was substantially altered in space environments. Glucose metabolism showed insulin resistance patterns. Lipid profiles shifted with elevated triglycerides. Energy expenditure patterns changed despite controlled diet. Metabolic rate decreased by 5-10% during long missions. Vitamin D deficiency was common despite supplementation. Gut microbiome composition shifted significantly.
