Study examining lack of norovirus replication and histo-blood group antigen. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes. Stress response pathways were universally upregulated. DNA repair genes showed increased expression. Mitochondrial genes were downregulated substantially. Epigenetic modifications included altered methylation patterns. Some changes persisted months after return to Earth. Cell cycle regulation genes were significantly affected.
