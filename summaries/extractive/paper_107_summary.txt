Bone density loss occurred at a rate of 1-2% per month during spaceflight. Osteoclast activity increased while osteoblast function decreased. Calcium metabolism was disrupted with increased urinary calcium excretion. Exercise countermeasures attenuated but did not prevent bone loss. Recovery of bone density post-flight required 6-12 months.
