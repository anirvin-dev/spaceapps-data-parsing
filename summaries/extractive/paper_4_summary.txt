This study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on human embryonic stem cells. Results showed that microgravity exposure significantly reduced stem cell differentiation capacity and regenerative potential. These findings have important implications for understanding tissue regeneration during spaceflight. The study found that microgravity alters stem cell morphology, with cells becoming more rounded and less adherent. Understanding how spaceflight affects stem cell function is critical for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration missions.
