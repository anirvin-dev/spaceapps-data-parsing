Study examining biocontrol in built environments to reduce pathogen exposure. Spaceflight induced significant immune system dysregulation. T-cell function was impaired with reduced proliferation capacity. Natural killer cell activity decreased substantially. Cytokine profiles shifted toward pro-inflammatory states. Latent viral reactivation occurred in 60% of crew members. Wound healing processes were delayed. Vaccine efficacy may be compromised in space environments.
