Study examining inhibition of sars-cov-2 wild-type (wuhan-hu-1) and delta (b.1.617.2). Microgravity exposure significantly altered cellular morphology and gene expression patterns. Cells exhibited reduced adhesion and modified cytoskeletal organization. Key signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt showed differential regulation. Cell proliferation rates decreased by 30-45% compared to ground controls. Apoptosis markers increased in spaceflight conditions. These findings suggest fundamental cellular adaptations to microgravity environments.
