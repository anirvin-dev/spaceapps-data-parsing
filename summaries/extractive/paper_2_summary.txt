This study investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying pelvic bone loss in a murine model of spaceflight. Results Hindlimb unloading resulted in significant pelvic bone loss ( reduction in bone mineral density). Abstract Microgravity exposure leads to significant bone loss in astronauts, particularly in weight-bearing bones. Introduction Bone loss is one of the most significant health concerns for astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. Conclusion Microgravity-induced pelvic bone loss is primarily mediated by increased osteoclastic activity and decreased osteoblastic function.
