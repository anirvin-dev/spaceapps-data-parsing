Study examining changes in the distribution and function of leukocytes. Cosmic radiation exposure caused significant DNA damage with increased double-strand breaks. Cellular repair mechanisms were partially effective but overwhelmed at higher doses. Oxidative stress markers were elevated substantially. Cell cycle checkpoints showed prolonged activation. Apoptosis rates increased dose-dependently. Long-term cancer risk estimates ranged from 3-5% for Mars missions.
