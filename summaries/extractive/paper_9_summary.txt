This study developed a high-precision mechanical loading system for studying bone adaptation in small animals. The system enables controlled cyclic loading to simulate physiological forces on long bones. Precision measurements demonstrated excellent repeatability and minimal variability across test cycles. The method provides a valuable tool for investigating bone mechanobiology and spaceflight-induced bone loss. Application to microgravity countermeasure research may inform exercise protocols for astronauts.
