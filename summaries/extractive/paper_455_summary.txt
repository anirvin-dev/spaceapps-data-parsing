Study examining blocking sars-cov-2 delta variant (b.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding. Spaceflight induced significant immune system dysregulation. T-cell function was impaired with reduced proliferation capacity. Natural killer cell activity decreased substantially. Cytokine profiles shifted toward pro-inflammatory states. Latent viral reactivation occurred in 60% of crew members. Wound healing processes were delayed. Vaccine efficacy may be compromised in space environments.
