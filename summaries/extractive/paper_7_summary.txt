Space radiation exposure causes dose-dependent and ion-specific oxidative stress responses in biological systems. High-LET particles induced more severe oxidative damage compared to low-LET radiation. Antioxidant enzyme activities varied significantly based on radiation type and dose. The study provides crucial data for radiation risk assessment during deep space missions. Understanding these dose-response relationships is essential for developing effective radiation countermeasures.
