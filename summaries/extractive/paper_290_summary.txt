Study examining characterization of gene expression profiles in the mouse. Neurological function showed multiple alterations during spaceflight. Cognitive performance declined in attention and spatial processing tasks. Brain structure changes included gray matter volume shifts. Intracranial pressure increased with optic nerve changes. Vestibular system adaptation required 3-7 days. Motor control and coordination were temporarily impaired. Neurotransmitter levels fluctuated significantly.
