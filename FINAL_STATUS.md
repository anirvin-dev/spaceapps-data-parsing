## 🎯 **Demo Script (3 Minutes)**

### **[0:00-0:30] Problem & Solution**

> "NASA has 600+ bioscience papers and experiments. Synthesizing this manually takes weeks. Our AI does it in minutes with full traceability."

### **[0:30-1:15] Paper Explorer (Show Summaries)**

> Navigate to: **Paper Explorer**
>
> Show paper with both extractive AND abstractive summaries
>
> "Every paper gets two types of summaries: extractive preserves exact quotes for accuracy, abstractive provides readable overviews. This hybrid approach prevents hallucinations."

### **[1:15-2:00] Consensus Claims (Evidence Panel)**

> Navigate to: **Consensus Claims**
>
> Click on "Microgravity reduces bone density" (85.3% consensus)
>
> "Our system identified this claim across 12 papers with 85% confidence. Every claim links to exact source sentences - judges can verify everything."

### **[2:00-2:45] Multi-Source Integration**

> Navigate to: **Additional NASA Sources**
>
> Show 648 total sources
>
> "We integrated 607 research papers plus NASA missions, OSDR experiments, Task Book projects, and PSI datasets. One unified knowledge base."

### **[2:45-3:00] Mission Insights**

> Navigate to: **Mission Insights**
>
> Show HIGH RISK insight with recommendation
